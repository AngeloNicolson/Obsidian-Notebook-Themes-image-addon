# Obsidian-Notebook-Themes v1.1.0
## A Series of Notebook Theme CSS Snippets for Obsidian.
These a few CSS classes that mimic a few of my real-world notebook pages and pen colors.
Go ahead and try it out! You can change or add new color variables or entire new
classes and combinations. Inside Obsidian, apply a page class with an optional
pen color class to see the effects. Add the `recolor-images` class to recolor
the images in your notes, too! Check out the full video going over the process [here](https://youtu.be/9T9VL8_i1Tg)!

### Page Background Colors
- Manila/Tan (`.page-manila`)
- Blueprint (`.page-blueprint`)

### Pen Colors
- Black (`.pen-black`)
- Gray (`.pen-gray`)
- Red (`.pen-red`)
